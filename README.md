## Built With
- Java

## Description
This reservation system simulates a real life airline flight registration system. At the start, the user is prompted with the following options:
### Add [P]assenger, Add [G]roup, [C]ancel Reservations, Print Seating [A]vailability Chart, Print [M]anifest, [Q]uit
The program allows the user to enter as many passengers as they want, provided there is open seating available, which can be checked with **Print Seating [A]vailability Chart**
When the user is finished, the program saves the reservations in a text file that will be parsed when the program is started again to fill the previously taken seats.
